This model according to the paper _A Theoretical Framework for Specificity in
Cell Signalling_ The model is "basic architecture" of Figure2A. Figure2B,
Figure2C have been reproduced by MathSBML. The reproduced figures are slightly
different from the original ones in the paper, the peak of [x2] is higher than
1 and is not decreasing dramatically when [x0]=0. And I think maybe the author
shift the or scale the curves.
